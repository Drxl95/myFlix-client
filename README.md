## MyFlix Client Application
This is a the front end of an API (myFlix) I built that contains a list of movies and relevent data including directors, actors, genre info etc.  It was created with React and has
Redux added to it.  The database for this app was created with MongoDB and is hosted on Atlas while the API is hosted on Heroku. Files for the backend can be found in a different repository called "movie_api".
